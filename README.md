### If you aren't hosting an instance of QuoteDB or don't have access to the hosted one below, not a plugin for you!

This is a simple HTTP-client plugin for [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) to enable you to retrieve/post quotes from/to the [QuoteDB web application](https://github.com/Elmuti/quotedb)
(Currently hosted on https://quotes.elmu.dev/)


![Example usage](https://i.imgur.com/Rvas5v0.png)


## Functionality

* Retrieve 'n'-number of quotes
* Create new quotes
* Persistent settings for Api BaseUrl/ApiToken (You'll need a token to use this!)

## Currently Work in progress


## Future plans

* Chat context menu action to create quotes directly from chat
